# SVG Logo Generator
This is a simple app that creates a logo by taking parameters such as text, shape and colours for text and shape.

## Description
This is another submission for the Usyd Coding Bootcamp. In this challenge we were required to make an SVG logo generator using node.js.  The app creates a 300pxwidth x 200px height logo in the shape of a triangle, square or circle, with text in the middle up to 3 characters. At the moment there are a limited amount of colours that the user is allowed to choose from however I plan on changing that to include hexdecimals so that options will be plentiful. 

During this challenge, I learnt how to install the inquirer package, how to use modules to seperate distinct parts of the code into different files. 

## Installation
1) Download and install Node.js
2) Open the intergrated terminal 
3) Install npm by typing 'npm install'
4) Install inquirer by typing 'npm install inquirer@8.2.4'
5) Install jest -> 'npm install --save-dev jest' OR 'npm i -d jest'

After installation ensure to change the 'test' to 'jest'. See video below for further clarification

## Usage

### Running the app
1) Open a new terminal in the CMD prompt, git or open an intergrated terminal in vscode.
2) Change directory to the parent folder of index.js
3) Start inquirer by typing node index.js
4) Fill out the prompts
5) Go to logo.svg and open in live server

### Jest testing
1) run the command 'npm run test'
